Current project I am working on. This project targets small/mid size construction company to manage their construction site. I am working on transferring my company's business process towards digitization. We always have a hansome number of running projects most of them are residential building. Many craftsmen works on each site everyday for various types of work like foundation, wall, earth work, door, floor, sanitary fittings etc. Its very cumbersome to manage all these craftsmen in terms of passing instruction, any update on their work, providing correction or feeding new requirements. This web and mobile based system will keep all the related craftsmen of a project updated about their work. Staff of our company will feed any udate in any plan or instruction to the system. The repective craftsmen will be notified through a mobile apps by means of push notification. All building and apartment will have a QR code attached to their entrance. Once a craftsmen arrive for work, He will only needs to scan the QR code and will get the instruction on leftover work, any update in plan/instruction or deadline. Once a craftman complete his work he can mark that work as done in the system.
